ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR THIS VERSION, WHICH USES MOOTOOLS 1.1X:

Make sure that there is an XHTML DOCTYPE declaration at the *very top* of the HTML pages where you want to use Slimbox,
so the browser will work in standards-compliant mode.
The DOCTYPE must be XHTML 1.0 transitional, XHTML 1.0 strict or XHTML 1.1. Example, for XHTML 1.0 transitional:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

*Important*: Do *not* add an XML prolog before the DOCTYPE.
If you add one, Internet Explorer 6 will not work in standards-compliant mode and Slimbox will not display correctly in this browser.
---

You can use the provided mootools.js and slimbox.js scripts "as is", or you can use a custom mootools build
downloaded from the official mootools website and/or edit the autoloading code inside slimbox.js.

You need to download a new mootools version if your web page scripts require additional mootools modules,
or if you want to use a different version of mootools.

Here are the mootools modules required by this version of Slimbox:
- Class: _all_
- Native: _all_
- Element: Element.Event
- Window: Window.DomReady, Window.Size
- Effects: Fx.Style, Fx.Styles (optionally Fx.Transitions)

You can remove or customize the provided autoload code block by editing the slimbox.js file. By default, it behaves like Lightbox.
When deploying slimbox.js, you MUST always preserve the copyright notice at the beginning of the file.

If you are a developer and want to edit the provided Slimbox source code, it is strongly recommended to minify the script using "YUI Compressor"
by Julien Lecomte before distribution. It will strip spaces and comments and shrink the variable names in order to obtain the smallest file size.

For more information, please read the documentation on the official project page.


Enjoy!
