=Launching Slimbox from Javascript code=

{{{
Slimbox.open()
}}}

You can launch Slimbox using Javascript to display a single image or a collection of images.

==Single image==

Call the {{{Slimbox.open()}}} method with the following parameters:

{{{
Slimbox.open(url, description, options);
}}}

  * *url* is _mandatory_, it's the URL of the image to display.
  * *description* is _optional_, it's the image description text.
  * *options* is _optional_, it's a javascript object where the keys are option names and the values depend on the key. The options are described in detail in the Slimbox [Manual#Setup manual]. Example of options object: {{{{ animateCaption: false, loop: true, overlayOpacity: 0.5 }}}}

_Examples:_

{{{
Slimbox.open("tree.jpg");
}}}

{{{
Slimbox.open("http://externalwebsite.com/tree.jpg", "My beautiful tree");
}}}

{{{
Slimbox.open("tree.jpg", "", {overlayOpacity: 0.2});
}}}

==Multiple images==

Call the {{{Slimbox.open()}}} method with the following parameters:

{{{
Slimbox.open(images, startImage, options);
}}}

  * *images* is _mandatory_, it's an array of arrays. The main array contains one array for each image. The second-level arrays contain the image URL as a _mandatory_ first element, and the image description as an _optional_ second element. Example, for 2 images: {{{[["image1.jpg"], ["image2.jpg", "description2"]]}}}
  * *startImage* is _mandatory_, it's the zero-based index of the image that you want to show first when Slimbox opens. 0 is the first image of the array, 1 is the second, etc. Of course, this value must be smaller than the size of the main array. Most of the time, you will use *0*.
  * *options* is _optional_, it's the same parameter as the one described above for displaying a single image.

_Examples:_

{{{
Slimbox.open([["cat.jpg", "Nice cat"], ["dog.jpg"]], 0);
}}}

{{{
Slimbox.open([["left.jpg"], ["middle.jpg"], ["right.jpg"]], 1, {loop: true});
}}}

=Enabling DOM elements (such as links) to launch Slimbox when clicking=

==The autoload code block==

The *autoload code block* is the readable code block located by default inside the slimbox.js file of the official Slimbox distribution. This code is using the Slimbox API to register Slimbox for a specific kind of links, so that Slimbox will open when the user clicks on any of these links. The registration is performed as soon as the DOM is ready.

The default implementation mimics the original Lightbox behavior: it registers Slimbox for all links ({{{<a>}}} tags) having a {{{rel}}} attribute value starting with the word "lightbox". If the {{{rel}}} attribute contains only the word "lightbox", it opens Slimbox to display a single image. Otherwise, it displays an image gallery containing all the images having the same {{{rel}}} attribute value as the one that was clicked, like "lightbox-animal" for example. For each link, its target ({{{href}}} attribute) is used as the image URL and its {{{title}}} attribute is used as an optional description shown in a caption below the image.

All the aspects of this default implementation may be freely changed to fit your needs thanks to the powerful Slimbox API. The following section explains how to do it.
