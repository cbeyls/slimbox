===v1.65 (2008-11-14)===

  * Regression fix: the slimbox fix that hides {{{<select>}}} tags in Internet Explorer to prevent them to appear above the div elements was mistakenly removed in v1.61. It is now working again.
  * Upgraded the provided mootools.js to version 1.2.1.

===v1.64 (2008-07-15)===

  * Fixed a bug where in some cases, Flash animations inserted using SWFObject would not show properly after Slimbox closes.

===v1.63 (2008-06-10)===

_requires mootools >= 1.2._

  * Updated code for mootools 1.2.
  * Slimbox is now fully compatible with Opera 9.5+ and quirks mode web pages!

===v1.52 (2008-06-08)===

  * Added the "loop" option to allow navigation between the first and last images of a Slimbox gallery, when there is more than one image to display.
  * Fixed a bug which allowed to change the image while Slimbox was closing.
  * API: The Slimbox elements functions now return "this" to allow chaining.
  * Small optimizations.

===v1.51 (2008-05-30)===

  * Fixed an error which occurred when Slimbox was used in combination with SWFObject in Firefox. Also fixes a memory leak in Internet Explorer.

===v1.5 (2008-05-23)===

  * Most of the code has been rewritten with a new approach. It's now much smaller! (4kb)
  * Added the "overlayOpacity" option to specify the level of opacity of the overlay.
  * Added the "counterText" option to specify a custom or localized counter text.
  * Slimbox does not take up any space at the bottom of the page any more in some browsers.
  * Now Slimbox does not wait for the caption animation to complete before enabling navigation. So you can navigate faster between images.
  * Keyboard events are now captured when Slimbox is open to prevent page scrolls when using the arrow keys to navigate.
  * You can now have two times the same image in an images set.
  * The CSS file now includes Z-index definitions that are required if your web page design relies on elements with Z-index.
  * The provided GIF images are now smaller.
  * API: Slimbox now extends the Element and Elements classes. You can now associate a Slimbox gallery to any group of link elements using {{{$$(elements).slimbox([options])}}}.
  * API: You can now specify different options for each group of link elements where you applied the {{{slimbox([options])}}} function.
  * API: When you call {{{slimbox()}}} on elements, you can now specify an optional filter function and an optional mapper function for maximum flexibility (see documentation).
  * The Lightbox compatibility code is now fully optional. It's implemented in a few lines using the new API and a filter function.
  * API: The main entry point has been renamed from "Lightbox" to "Slimbox"
  * API: {{{Lightbox.show()}}} and {{{Lightbox.open()}}} have been merged into {{{Slimbox.open()}}}
  * The Slimbox distribution now includes mootools, an example page and a Readme file.

===v1.41 (2007-06-12)===

  * Visibility of objects (including Flash animations) are now set to their original values when Slimbox is closed, instead of always being set to visible.
