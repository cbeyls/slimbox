From a _functional_ point of view, Slimbox has the following added features compared to the original Lightbox:

  * Slimbox is ready to launch as soon as the document is ready. This means that you don’t have to wait for all images of the page to be loaded before clicking on a link launching the Lightbox effect.
  * The left and right arrow keys can be used to navigate through images, and the ESC key can be used to close Slimbox (Warning: in Mozilla browsers, the ESC key is also used to stop GIF images from animating).
  * The dark background overlay can be clicked anywhere to close Slimbox, even on the parts located on the left and right of the image.
  * The script is more robust; for example you can try to start-stop Slimbox very quickly to interrupt the animation then resume it and you won’t notice any bug like in the original Lightbox where sometimes the animation stops or the captions are wrongly sized.
  * Slimbox temporary hides flash animations and other embedded videos while it is open to avoid display bugs in some browsers.
  * Slimbox can be launched from the traditional image links inside the page like the original Lightbox, but also directly from a Javascript call using a special method.

From a _design_ point of view, Slimbox is very different from Lightbox:

  * The code has been entirely rewritten with efficiency in mind for the mootools framework instead of the huge Prototype/Scriptaculous. The script itself is as tiny as 4kb (uncompressed).
  * The Slimbox CSS are simpler and 100% valid (no more CSS hacks). Also, all images used by Slimbox are specified in the CSS instead of the Javascript so it is easier to style.
  * Slimbox does not use the 1 pixel transparent gif image needed by Lightbox.

And of course, it has been tested in all modern browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer 6+, Opera 8+, Safari 1.3+ and Camino. It is not compatible with the old Internet Explorer 5.5 and will never be.

The total download size for the compressed version of the required modules of mootools + Slimbox is currently as small as *26kb*.
