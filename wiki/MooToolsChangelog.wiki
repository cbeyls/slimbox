#summary The history of changes for each official release of Slimbox 1
#labels Phase-Support

===v1.8 (2011-08-21)===

_requires mootools >= 1.3_

   * Updated core code and plugins for mootools 1.3, including the usage of CSS selectors instead of filtering functions.

===v1.71 (2009-11-19)===

   * Now Slimbox does not activate by default on mobile devices.
   * Changed the default autoload code block to activate only on "a" elements instead of "document.links" which also includes "area" elements. "area" elements can still be used but not with the default Lightbox behavior because they do not support the "rel" attribute in a standard way.
   * Upgraded the provided mootools.js to version 1.2.4.

===v1.7 (2009-04-29)===

   * Fixed code for mootools 1.2.2.
   * Upgraded the provided mootools.js to version 1.2.2.

===v1.69 (2009-01-28)===

   * Fixed a bug in smart preloading which caused Slimbox to perform an unnecessary HTTP GET request.
   * The Picasa Web Albums integration example script is now also compatible with square thumbnails.

===v1.68 (2008-12-24)===

   * Fixed "next" and "prev" links not showing in Opera 9. This bug was introduced in the last version.
   * Removed the 1px right margin CSS fix for IE6 and IE7 quirks mode (introduced in the last version) because it caused the 1px right margin to appear in Safari, Chrome and Opera instead. *CSS update required.*
   * Small code optimizations.
   * Added a fix in Slimbox 1.56 for mootools 1.11 to make it compatible with Opera 9.5+ and Opera 9.3 for Wii. Sadly, mootools 1.2 is not compatible with Opera for Wii.

===v1.67 (2008-12-08)===

   * Keyboard navigation is now always enabled, allowing instant keyboard navigation to any image without having to wait for the images to load or the effects to complete.
   * In supported browsers like Firefox and IE, images preloading is now stopped when Slimbox is closed or when the user navigates to another image. This saves server bandwidth and allocates the full bandwidth for the currently viewed image rather than old image preloads.
   * Images are not cropped anymore in quirks mode IE (this was due to the IE box model bug). *CSS update required.*
   * Select boxes are now hidden in IE6 only because IE7 fixes the select boxes problem.
   * Code optimizations.

===v1.66 (2008-12-02)===

   * New overlay implementation which works much better with standards-compliant browsers. A compatibility mode has been added for other browsers (IE6 and quirks mode IE7). *CSS update required.*
   * Now fully compatible with horizontal scrolling websites (overlay + box centering).
   * The images are now also vertically centered in the browser window on startup. Vertical scrolling is still possible.
   * Added customizable keyboard navigation (as often requested) using new options: "closeKeys", "previousKeys" and "nextKeys".
   * Added new options to set effects duration: "overlayFadeDuration", "imageFadeDuration" and "captionAnimationDuration" which replaces "animateCaption". Each animation can now be disabled by setting these options to {{{0}}}.
   * Removed the "showCounter" option, you can now set the "counterText" option to {{{false}}} or {{{""}}} to disable the counter display.
   * CSS: The bottom div block can now be styled with any border width, they don't need to match the border widths of the center div block anymore.
   * Many code optimizations.
   * 3 useful extra scripts and a new example image are now provided in the distribution file.

===v1.65 (2008-11-14)===

  * Regression fix: the code fix which hides select boxes in Internet Explorer to prevent them to appear above the overlay was mistakenly removed in v1.61. It is now working again.
  * Upgraded the provided mootools.js to version 1.2.1.

===v1.64 (2008-07-15)===

  * Fixed a bug where in some cases, Flash animations inserted using SWFObject would not show properly after Slimbox closes.

===v1.63 (2008-06-10)===

_requires mootools >= 1.2_

  * Updated code for mootools 1.2.
  * Slimbox is now fully compatible with Opera 9.5+ and quirks mode web pages!

===v1.52 (2008-06-08)===

  * Added the "loop" option to allow navigation between the first and last images of a Slimbox gallery, when there is more than one image to display.
  * Fixed a bug which allowed to change the image while Slimbox was closing.
  * API: The Slimbox elements functions now return "this" to allow chaining.
  * Small optimizations.

===v1.51 (2008-05-30)===

  * Fixed an error which occurred when Slimbox was used in combination with SWFObject in Firefox. Also fixes a memory leak in Internet Explorer.

===v1.5 (2008-05-23)===

  * Most of the code has been rewritten with a new approach. It's now much smaller! (4kb)
  * Added the "overlayOpacity" option to specify the level of opacity of the overlay.
  * Added the "counterText" option to specify a custom or localized counter text.
  * Slimbox does not take up any space at the bottom of the page any more in some browsers.
  * Now Slimbox does not wait for the caption animation to complete before enabling navigation. So you can navigate faster between images.
  * Keyboard events are now captured when Slimbox is open to prevent page scrolls when using the arrow keys to navigate.
  * You can now have two times the same image in an images set.
  * The CSS file now includes Z-index definitions that are required if your web page design relies on elements with Z-index.
  * The provided GIF images are now smaller.
  * API: Slimbox now extends the Element and Elements classes. You can now associate a Slimbox gallery to any group of link elements using {{{$$(elements).slimbox([options])}}}.
  * API: You can now specify different options for each group of link elements where you applied the {{{slimbox([options])}}} function.
  * API: When you call {{{slimbox()}}} on elements, you can now specify an optional filter function and an optional mapper function for maximum flexibility (see documentation).
  * The Lightbox compatibility code is now fully optional. It's implemented in a few lines using the new API and a filter function.
  * API: The main entry point has been renamed from "Lightbox" to "Slimbox"
  * API: {{{Lightbox.show()}}} and {{{Lightbox.open()}}} have been merged into {{{Slimbox.open()}}}
  * The Slimbox distribution now includes mootools, an example page and a Readme file.

===v1.41 (2007-06-12)===

  * Fixed a small CSS glitch for "next" and "prev" zones display.
  * Removed the IE "white noise" fix, it is now fixed by mootools 1.1 (thanks digitarald).

===v1.4 (2007-05-21)===

_requires mootools >= 1.1_

  * Updated code for mootools 1.1.
  * Added an option to hide the counter.

===v1.31 (2007-05-04)===

  * Fixed the "white noise" bug occurring in dark areas of JPEG images in Internet Explorer.
  * Visibility of objects (including Flash animations) are now set to their original values when Slimbox is closed, instead of always being set to visible.
  * Re-added the hiding of {{{<embed>}}} tags. It was accidentally removed in v1.3.

===v1.3 (2007-02-05)===

_requires mootools >= 1.0_

  * Updated code for mootools 1.0.
  * The caption now animates using a nice slide effect like the original Lightbox. *CSS update required.*
  * Added an option to set any custom transition from the mootools Transitions class for the resize animation.

===v1.22 (2006-11-06)===

  * Now also hides {{{<embed>}}} tags while Slimbox is opened, not just {{{<object>}}} tags. Thanks Felix from Germany.

===v1.21 (2006-11-05)===

  * Shorter code, slightly reduced file size.

===v1.2 (2006-11-04)===

  * Fixed serious performance issues with long HTML pages in Internet Explorer.
  * Fixed overlay not entirely covering the screen when the window is resized/scrolled in specific cases.
  * Now bulletproof to overlay mad-clicking.
  * Hidden objects now reappear after the overlay fade out effect instead of before it.
